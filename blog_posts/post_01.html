			      	<h2><strong>A BLOG! :</strong> some kind of intro</h2>
              <p> Hello world! Isn't that how these are supposed to start? </p>
              <p> Blogging isn't so bad, but really writing any kind of intro for myself is a struggle. It's not that there is no start but that there are too many places to start, which leaves me to default to context. Obviously I'm setting up this site, I am studying software development or "code" with Turing's back end engineering program. It's fun, it's hard, and the pursuit runs a gambit from super dry and mundane to mindblowing and exciting. </p>
              <p> I get a long with learning code because I'm a person that wants to know how stuff works. I've studied natural science, social science, and electrical engineering. I'll probably stay away from partical physics and astronomy, but I like knowing a broad range of <em> if this, now what </em> kind of information. </p>
              <p> I still believe knowledge is power. Power doesn't yield opportunity or even success but at least the privilege to act on opportunity. Power also demands responsibility, all actions have consequences.	</p>
              <p> I feel that subject grew tangents quickly, but hey, here's an intro. </p>
